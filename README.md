# memory-game






Technology used:</br>
Vanilla html, css, and javascript



</br>
Approach:</br>
I started out with basic idea of a grid card format with a few option buttons for changing the amount of cards. I use an array of colors and pull/shuffle the appropriate number for each game. I use a default background color as an easy way to differentiate cards a player has chosen. After building base functionality and designing CSS layout I began adding additional enhancements such as a turn counter, timer, and random themes.

# Main features:
- Different difficulty levels
- Random theme option
- Ability to change theme without losing game progress
- Turn counter
- Game timer
</br>



# What's left:
- Allow players to select themes in addition to choosing random ones.
- Change for just colors when flipped to pictures.
- Transition to a more education based game using themes with pictures of fruits, vegetables, animals, planets, etc.
