# memory-game


Technology used:
Vanilla html, css, and javascript

Approach:
I started out with basic idea of a grid card format with a few option buttons for changing the amount of cards. I use an array of colors and pull/shuffle the appropriate number for each game. I use a default color (white) for the back of cards and this allowed an easy way to differentiate cards a player has chosen. After building base functionality and designing CSS layout I began adding additional options of a turn counter, timer, and the addition of themes. 

Main features:
Different difficulty levels
Random theme option
Ability to change theme without losing game progress
Turn counter
Game timer

What's left?
Allow players to select themes in addition to choosing random ones.
Change for just colors when flipped to pictures.
Transition to a more education based game using themes with pictures of fruits, vegetables, animals, planets, etc.
